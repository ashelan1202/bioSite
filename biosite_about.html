		<p>Zena Quach is 24 years old, born June 16, 1999, who grew up in Modesto, CA and now lives in Santa Clara, CA with their partner. They identify as female (she/her) and she is a queer Vietnamese American. Currently, Zena’s occupation is as a process engineer in manufacturing photonic devices. In 2021, she graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering, and this is one of the thing’s that she is most proud of herself for accomplishing. Her current hobbies include reading, taking care of her houseplants, and playing video games of all kinds.</p> 
		<p>Growing up in the suburbs of Modesto, CA with her family consisting of her two parents and younger sister, Zena focused a lot of her time on her education. She was extremely studious, and she was heavily engaged with her school’s community through leadership activities, being a part of the tennis team, and joining her school’s key club. Despite growing up and moving away from her hometown, Zena still holds on to a lot of her hobbies and interests that she had when she was younger. Even as a child, she was always reading, and would even go to the local library weekly with her father to check out new books to read. Zena was so dedicated to reading, that she found herself at times wishing that she had the power to stop time. If she were able to press pause on the world, she would use the opportunity to read for as long as she wanted without having to worry about any outside obligations that she had. Once iPods and computers became more accessible, Zena was able to engage more with her hobby of playing mobile games and other types of video games on a computer.</p>
		<p>Zena’s current life as an adult is a lot different, but she also carries a lot of her past with her as well. She still reads and plays video games, but she now has taken up the hobby of taking care of houseplants as well. This hobby came about as she moved out of her parent’s home and started creating a space of her own. Her day-to-day life consists of waking up to go to work and coming back home to workout and cook dinner with her partner. She makes sure to prepare herself for the next day before having a bit of leisure time until she falls asleep.</p>
		<p>For the future, Zena hopes to be able to buy a home or a condo some day once she has the sufficient funds for it. One of her other aspirations in life is to be able to enjoy every moment as much as possible, and to be able to find joy in all of life’s phases, whether difficult or not. When she’s struggling to feel motivated, she thinks of the future she could have with her partner if she continues to work hard, and that’s what helps Zena pick herself up again. Another motivating factor for her is having an uplifting playlist to elevate the mood, which can consist of a mix of pop, R&B, indie, and k-pop music. Although Zena, can seem a bit reserved and quiet, once you get to know her, you really get to see a different side of her that is more outgoing and playful. If money weren’t a concern for her, she would want to dedicate her life completely to her hobbies and live somewhere that she could grow a garden in. She would want to take care of cats and grow her own produce, as well as be able to travel to many different places across the globe. In these dreams of hers, you can really see the outgoing, playful, and bright spirited nature that Zena possesses, and it’s a side of her that makes you feel fortunate that you were able to cross paths with her.</p>
